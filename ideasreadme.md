? What is the exact workflow for all possible workflows  - i need to make a flowchart of all this.  use loom and have him record him organizing it?

i'd like a timeline ind of indicator maybe even 2 pixels tall for each so you can see the 'progress'  of each job.

#1 - bring in both email and text to same place.  to same ticket.
#2 - automagically putting that ticket with a person
#3 - making the status of 


Based on the transcript, I'll help design a comprehensive lead status tracking system. Here are key ways to make lead tracking simple and effective:



a timeline of each lead, a line that shows where each lead is at a glance visually?
it could be vertical in the lead, but could also be a horizontal line in the list
i imagine seeing a list of leads (that a rep has) and there is a maybe 10 pixel tall line full width with the sections, and indicator where each is at.   of course some wont have as many steps as others, but somehow unify it so that you can scroll down with your eyes and visualize information.  we could use colors maybe to signify how long in each state?  how might that look? 
maybe the color signifies the reasonable delay of response at each step.  if you see orange, or red, ud jump on it.  ESP if there is no status?  the colors fade if they are past, active place would be different.




Here are key features to implement for effective lead tracking:

1. Automated Status Updates:
- Implement automatic status changes based on actions (e.g., when payment is received, automatically move to "Payment Received")
- Create clear status categories like "New Lead", "Pending Response", "Quote Sent", "Payment Received", etc.
* - Add visual indicators for time in each status (e.g., turning red after 24 hours)

2. Priority Management:
- Auto-prioritize leads based on criteria like:
  - Time in current status
  - Location (in-state vs out-of-state)
  - Type (commercial vs residential)
  - Source (web form, chat, phone)
- Visual indicators for high-priority leads needing attention

3. Notification System:
- Alert representatives when:
  - New leads are assigned to them
  - A lead has been in the same status for >24 hours
  - Customer responds to messages
  - Payment is received
- Daily digest of leads requiring follow-up
- a follow up after job is done.

4. Smart Assignment:
- Implement round-robin distribution with intelligence:
  - Consider rep availability
  - Match lead type to rep expertise (commercial vs residential) (2 commercial emails came in while i was there..., also 2 were no gos, jobsthey cant do)
  - Geographic considerations
- Allow manual reassignment when needed

5. Activity Timeline:
- Track all interactions in chronological order
- Include automated and manual status changes
- Log all communications (email, chat, phone)
- Document uploads (photos, quotes, invoices)

6. Quick Actions:
- One-click status updates
- Templated responses
- Easy reassignment options
- Quick filters to find leads by status/rep/priority

7. Dashboard Views:
- Manager overview of all leads and statuses
- Rep-specific views of their assigned leads
- Team performance metrics
- Aging lead reports
- highlight any unusual data, low call volume, low sales, big changes etc.

COULD get their personal email in here?

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or show how specific features could be implemented?




from adam
most important thing is to see where customer came from, what we paid for that lead and if it converted or if it didnt and why.   was it price.   were we too far out in scheduling.  was it something else.  on sales side important they have follow ups.   u havnt talked to this customer.   at one point we want to notify manager, this customer hasnt been contacted check on sales rep.  
		want customers taken care of and taken care of, touched also.  want 
			what you think about this quote.  do u want to take something off.  whatsales interactions
		give a quote out of the crm.   did they forward quote, reject quote.  turn that job if sold .   what we do is put customers into service hub.  want 

we want them to be charged and put into service hub if they paid - sergice hub.  if reject contact them say sorry. take data as a marketing tool to collect and push out to blast email email.


lead pipeline
place to leave notes
right now they are using email - got a poor google review cuz they tried ot give them money
		went out and did work, but there was no follow up after customer paid.
		

left hand doesnt know what right is doing.   sales, and service.
		handle is this much, going to be this much.
	
go through sales customer
